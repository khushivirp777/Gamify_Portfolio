# Gamify_Portfolio
**Overview:**
Gamify Portfolio is an innovative web application designed to transform the traditional process of creating and maintaining a personal portfolio into an engaging and interactive experience.
This project leverages gamification principles to motivate users to showcase their skills, achievements, projects, and academic records in a fun and dynamic way.

## Key Features:

**User Levels and Progression:**

Users are awarded levels based on the completion and quality of their portfolio sections such as introduction, achievements, projects, academic scores, and more.
Each section has specific criteria that users need to meet to earn points and advance to higher levels.
Interactive Portfolio Sections:

**Introduction:** Users provide their personal information and a brief bio.
**Achievements:** Users list their notable accomplishments and receive points for each entry.
**Projects:** Detailed project descriptions, technologies used, and roles played are documented and scored.
**Academics:** Academic scores and qualifications are entered, contributing to the user's overall level.

**Gamification Elements:**

Badges and trophies are awarded for milestones and exceptional entries.
Leaderboards to compare progress with peers.
Progress bars and level indicators to visualize advancement.
Technology Stack:

**Frontend: React**

Utilizes React to create a responsive, dynamic, and interactive user interface.
Implements components for different sections of the portfolio, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Backend: Node.js**

Handles server-side logic, user authentication, and session management.
Provides APIs for data interaction and real-time updates.

**Database: MySQL**

Stores user data, portfolio entries, and progress metrics.
Ensures data integrity and supports complex queries for gamification features.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
